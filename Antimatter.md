Antimatter

### Antimatter - The amount of entropy that can be produced relative to the matter being observed.

 _A Higgs Boson is a scalar particle. It produces more entropy. Even me writing about it now, is proving that to be true._

If matter is the idea, then antimatter is all that can spawn from that idea alone. Essentially, take the smallest component of something (matter), and the antimatter is all that will come from that single part of matter. If light shines up an area, it's all the possibilities of state for that lit area.

Nikola Tesla called this the “ether” and stated that without light there is no matter. Because you need to have light on it, in order for it to be observed/measurable, to some degree. Basically a form of energy signature, be it magnetic, or visual, or infra red. Because in order to see it on that, you still need light to be presented to the observer for the results. Be it on a computer screen, or anything, but light is needed always. This is why Nikola Tesla believed that “everything” was the light.

This is antimatter. It’s the maximum region for potential entropy, relative to a single particle. Like, ELI5 it’s the maximum number of multiverses that a single point in time can have, and all the possible moments in other multiverses, occurring within this region. 

I would consider antimatter and dark matter to be the same thing. A zero point energy.

** Edit - I just came back to write that this is in this repo and is labelled as "The Twist", I had written about it in a different context, but these two are in principle the same thing explained in a different way!
