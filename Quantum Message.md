Splitting The Quanta

The year is 2021, December 10/12/21.

The Earth’s estimated trajectory around the sun has it traveling at 940,000,000 km per year. That’s:
* 2,575,342km per day.
* 107,305km per hour.
* 17,884km every 10 minutes.

On a digital proof of work system:
* Bitcoin blocks
* 17,884km per block.
* Current blockheight (per my node running atm, thanks mempool and Ketan for the setup!): 713461
* Block 7,140,000 (end of final reward era of zero).
* Estimated Duration: 6,426,539 blocks.
* Distance Travelled: 6,040,946,660,000,000 km (6 Quadrillion, 40 Trillion, 946 Billion, 660 Million kilometres away).

Now lets teleport down into a block. Lets imagine ourselves as a piece of digital information piloting through blocks like we’re Luke Skywalker through blocks. Imagine we’re in a warp bubble, going through blocks as a message through time into the future. How far would we go? What would we see when we come out at the other end? What would be valuable then? Well, it’s likely valuable to them. 

On Orbital System:
* Earth Orbits the Milky Way every 225-250 million years.
* 235,000,000,000,000,000 km (235 Quadrillion kilometres orbit the milky way).

Now, I have attempted to entangle a bitcoin into two parts, so that we have a set of checkpoints if we need to reference points in space/time. I split the key between half a bitcoin into the address, and the other half in the time lock address that the public key generated for a time lock of 7140000. The goal is that this first half would be stolen when I first published the key details. The faster the coins were stolen, the stronger the signal strength I deemed. Because if it’s valuable today, and it’s the heaviest proof of work, then it will have future value to future generations, thus, donating the other half of the coin (which is a lot of relative energy to the civilisation at the time, relative to the historical entropy growth of the system (block reward). 

By entangling particles (the two addresses, holding the two batches of 50 million satoshi’s) by way of deriving the keys from the same public key, we can ensure a predictable behaviour on the other side of the particle. Thus providing assurance that if the state of the first entangle part (the 50 million satoshi’s in the normal address) is has given us more information about the likely state of the other particles locked at the end of time in the time lock address. So any two particles are then said to be entangled if either can effect the state of one another.

We can think of this like we are teleporting a particle across the galaxy, and we’re going to observe what happens to the first particles today, and that behaviour should yield additional insights as to the behaviour of the counter entangled particles.

This means also, without getting too meta, but it means that someone is looking back on the chain, like a cryptographic archeologist, so they would be connecting the links between the information in the key at the time, and the information as it’s presented today, within their cryptographic systems (whatever language then spoken or used digitally, it will still have a path back to these origins in this moment of space/time, as you read this today.


End Result:
* Our message will travel 6 Quadrillion Kilometres. Instantly.
* There should be a high degree the funds will be taken from the time lock, if they can be taken. Similar to Murphys law. If the bitcoins can be stolen deeming them valuable today, then bitcoins can be valuable in the future decades from now.
* A digital proof of work system, between Satoshi’s Genesis Block, the entangled address, the entangled time lock address.
* The time lock address is after the largest prime number in our set, and represents the start of a new cycle. Like a clock flicking from AM to PM.
*Fork proofing bitcoin - Given there’s now no way for another chain to fork this message, it provides a fork proof security property for Bitcoin. Because any chain that forks off, you would only need to check the time their chain started or changed state, and it would be considered fraudulent if started after this time. Anybody could challenge the premise, but they would need more value locked up at the equivalent time in the future, and it would need to equate to more work than bitcoin’s weight at the time, but that’s impossible given its current weight, so it makes it almost like a self fulfilling system. So regardless of the future network participants, this should guide the network to maintain a strict limit on the block size and reward structure and never changing. Changes to that then could risk signal attenuation through space/time.

The only difference in comprehension between the systems is semantics. But its still interpretable, irrespective of semantics, because semantics as a topic with any point in this context, means they have an alternate understanding that misaligns with the message above. To have a different interpretation of the message, means comparison against a format known to yourself. In before the "AckKtktuallyyyyyy" people do their thing :) . Thus the further number of interpretations, the higher probability of the message surviving the archives of time. This way, people in years ahead will be able to retrieve the energy that I believe will be astronomically more valuable than anything in their local star system, thus it'll be an accumulation of all their energy at the time, but more. Following the pattern of prime numbers which I believe represent folds in entropy systems.

### Explaining - “1+1=3=Pi”

Appearing to be visually congruent (as all key derivation paths must be), the equation is congruent to increase comprehension probability at the time, regardless of language of origin. We know that networks must be positive sum, and we know that they’re digital, meaning triangular representations constructed to present the information to our eyes for processing. Given we see two circles when we process information, it essentially makes 2pi our field of view. So if machines smallest is a triangle, and we represent dots as rational approximations of 2Pi, then a triangle is representing Pi, having three sides, and three points. Similar to our two eyes + our perspective, is our field of view to see 2Pi. 

* 1+1=3 // Needed for a distributed system to grow. A system can’t grow if it is not positive sum.

* 3 = Pi // Any node on the network worth looking at (containing energy) at the time, would be a dot in the sky, and we would know that is circular because every representation on a computer screen must be some rational approximation of Pi / 2Pi. If everything is a rational approximation for Pi, and we make visual graphics from lots and lots of little triangles, then there exists thermal equilibrium between those two systems. Thus leaving no residue or tensors that would exceed the total number of 3. The tensors and residue is the infinite part after 3. Leaving Pi. Represented by two points of entropy, relative to a certain point of reference. Pi could be though of as a “Primary Intersection” where two points are relative to one another.

I have tried my very best to encode as much information into this key as possible, and I'll continue updating it either here, or wherever! To me, this means that we are misunderstanding bitcoin. It's an energy system, and a quantum telephone if you will. Our job should be to preserve this like our crown jewel as a species. No pollution on chain etc… This way we are all Satoshi Nakamoto as we all will probably share keys with them in the future.

This is what I believe other civilizations referred to as ancestors, thus their love for big proofs of work (sculptures/statues) - Stonehenge, 3 blocks per frame. Pyramids, triangular. All following a similar formula operating in units of Pi, sending the same Quantum Message attempt to outer galaxies. The shininess of the pyramids, and the burial with gold and buried treasures around the sea, and all this stuff sort of leads me to believe this was there way of “throwing it forward” in their own eras. Having shiny goods on was because they were shiny, but more specifically, they shined light to people thus making them more “light” to be around, as they perceived more light to be more entropy. More entropy making people happier or more “memorable” from a larger energy signature left on the eyes from being within proximity.

I tried to upload to IPFS too, but not quite sure it worked, but it would be cool to try it as it could be used to compare the timestamps I think. QmTfG1m1Tep944fZH6x1ZRCLRyuX1hVAPxTNQgTrE1sRho
