# Energy

All matter behaves the same, because representations of matter mean they are bound to the same laws of thermodynamics that we are. Only differing by perspective of the observer.

### Bitcoin Authenticator
Google Authenticator, but instead of using a central server to generate secret codes, we use the bitcoin blockchain to generate the code for us.

### Nikola Tesla
A fascinating thinker, and I found this interview really really helpful to try and empathise with what he is saying, and how he is thinking. It's creativity and originality at its finest. Felt like others may also enjoy reading it!

### Open Source Energy
An Implementation of Teslas original designs. Utilising the earths ionosphere generated by the velocity of orbiting the sun. Placing two Tesla towers equidistant on earth, to ignite the ionosphere, like a giant, renewable battery. It stops working when the earth stops revolving around the sun.

### Quantum Clock
This is a time format used to ensure the heaviest proof of work system is always used as a record keeping device, and a source of alignment for distributed systems.

### Quantum Message
The message to be received by civilization 100+ years from now. Encoding formulas for prime numbers and other components. It's unvalidated today, but my hope is that it is validated by people in the future, who can then help expedite it to be validated in this day.

### Time Travel
High level around fibre optic cables and their attenuation of signal, and how we can use the Bitcoin blockchain for zero attentuation signal transfer (think fibre optics, but through time, instead of across countries).

### The Twist
This is a microscopic quantum moment in space/time which if observed, changes the trajectory of all things into the future. Like bending spacetime, but instead we twist it. Twist implies bending both sides of spacetime (the observer, and the destination).

### Bitcoin Scaling
An open design and reference implementation for solving the block reward problem. (edit: solving)
