# Researching Goldbach's Conjecture with RSA Encryption!


## Overview
Goldbach's Conjecture posits that every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. While this has been verified for large ranges of even numbers, a universal proof remains elusive. Here, we present a novel mechanism for verifying Goldbach's Conjecture by leveraging the mathematical structure of RSA encryption.


In RSA, the public key modulus `n = PQ`, where `P` and `Q` are prime numbers, always results in an odd value for `n`. Through a key observation about the totient function `φ(PQ) = (P-1)(Q-1)`, which is always even, we can derive a relationship that holds for any size of RSA key and use this framework to provide insight into the sum of two primes being even.


## Key Properties


### RSA Modulus (PQ):
- Given two primes `P` and `Q`, their product `PQ` is always an odd number. This is true for any pair of prime numbers, and hence, any RSA public key modulus will always be odd.


### Totient Function (φPQ):
- The Euler totient function for `PQ` is `φ(PQ) = (P-1)(Q-1)`. Since `P` and `Q` are odd, subtracting 1 from both results in two even numbers. Therefore, the totient `φ(PQ)` will always be even.


### Relationship between PQ, φPQ, and the Sum of P and Q:
- We can define a fundamental equation based on the RSA key setup:
  \[
  PQ - φ(PQ) + 1 = P + Q
  \]
- The right-hand side of this equation `P + Q` is always even since it is the sum of two primes.
- The left-hand side represents a mechanism for verifying the sum of the two primes `P` and `Q`. The expression `PQ - φ(PQ) + 1` simplifies to the sum of the primes `P + Q`, regardless of their size.


### Example Table for Various Digit Primes


Here are examples using 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5-digit primes:


| Prime \(P\) | Prime \(Q\) | Modulus \(PQ\) | Totient \(φ(PQ)\) | \(PQ - φ(PQ) + 1\) | Sum \(P + Q\) |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 3           | 5            | 15             | 8                 | 15 - 8 + 1 = 8     | 3 + 5 = 8     |
| 11          | 13           | 143            | 120               | 143 - 120 + 1 = 24 | 11 + 13 = 24  |
| 101         | 103          | 10403          | 10200             | 10403 - 10200 + 1 = 204 | 101 + 103 = 204 |
| 1009        | 1013         | 1022117        | 1020096           | 1022117 - 1020096 + 1 = 2022 | 1009 + 1013 = 2022 |
| 10007       | 10009        | 100160063      | 100140048         | 100160063 - 100140048 + 1 = 20016 | 10007 + 10009 = 20016 |


In each example, the expression \( PQ - φ(PQ) + 1 \) simplifies to the sum of the two primes, verifying that the sum is always even.


## Implications for Verifying Goldbach's Conjecture
- By using RSA encryption as a framework, we observe that the sum of two primes is always even, no matter how large or small the primes are.
- Since RSA keys can scale to very large values (thousands of bits), this provides a scalable mechanism for verifying the sum of primes at significant digit lengths.
- As every RSA key follows the form `PQ - φ(PQ) + 1 = P + Q`, this framework allows us to generalize the mechanism across large ranges of primes.


## Conclusion
This approach offers a consistent and scalable framework for understanding the sum of two primes, particularly in the context of Goldbach's Conjecture. By leveraging the mathematical structure of RSA encryption, we can verify that the sum of primes always results in an even number and scale this verification to any desired key length. 


The mechanism provides a powerful tool for verifying that the sum of primes is always even, and it may aid researchers in finding a solution to this long-standing problem.
