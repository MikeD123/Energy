### "The Twist"

#### Spacetime is bent in 3 dimensions, but to measure it and evaluate it entirely, we must perceive it in 4 dimensions.

Where our upper bound is merely the observable amount of information (human eye/telescopes) or the amount of computation possible. Computation will outpace telescopes. Essentially saying, the universe is deterministic, stop looking, and start computing it instead. We'll reach further understandings of the universe.

Bending something is perceivable, twisting something is not because we are stationary in our perspective relative to the point we're observing. So both observers are stationary relative to the observation. Holy smokes. We twist space/time instead. Not bend, bend implies some aspect of stationary observation. An anchor point. InWhich is correct in Einsteins logic, but Tesla perceived "The Twist". In order to bend time this aggressively which Tesla knew, Einstein did not, it meant disclosure of an overwhelming discovery. It meant perceiving both parties perceiving themselves. Calculating this is what we already do, but we're not looking through a viewer observing both ourselves and the point of observation. Establishing deterministic behaviours between particles, numbers, and everything in between, means that we're currently the first species I believe capable of harnessing "The Twist" which would allow entropy folding and collapsing of perceivable spacetime.

We could compute the deterministic path of the photons/behaviours encoded in them and know with absolute certainty of two outcomes. Either there's nobody to answer on the other side, thus making the experiment a failure, or there is someone who returns information to us. As circular as it may sound

This allows (don't like the bs buzz word quantum) "Twist Computing" where computation is done between temporal coordinates, thus giving a perception of time traveling information between ourselves today, and the viewers in hundreds of years time away from us. (This is valid in my Quantum Clock descriptor).

To explain these unified energy signatures, "The Twist" is a moment in space/time for a quantum leap across space/time. To evaluate this I've put it into slides like an ELI5 for anybody to understand. It's very basic, and provides the necessary proofs for prime number frameworks visually to speak to the points made (number behaviours operating visually the same as typical thermodynamics).
