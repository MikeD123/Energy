### Faster Than Light Zero Attentuation Signal Transfer

### Computer networks 
Fiber-optic cables are now the main way of carrying information over long distances because they have three very big advantages over old-style copper cables:

* **Less attenuation:** (signal loss) Information travels roughly 10 times further before it needs amplifyingâ€”which makes fiber networks simpler and cheaper to operate and maintain.
* **No interference:** Unlike with copper cables, there's no "crosstalk" (electromagnetic interference) between optical fibers, so they transmit information more reliably with better signal quality
* **Higher bandwidth:** As we've already seen, fiber-optic cables can carry far more data than copper cables of the same diameter.

### Timechain Networks
Bitcoin blocks are now the main way of carrying information over long distances because they have three very big advantages over old-style fiber optic cables:

* **Zero attenuation:** (zero signal loss) Information/Energy travels at the speed of light, and is buried by the heaviest amount of work, which is a direct correlation to its duration of immutability. Immutability forms a set of predictability, predictability reduces signal volatility, signal volatility directly influences attentuation.

* **No interference:** Unlike with fiber cables, there's no recipient bandwidth requried at the time of sending. Meaning, the tower receiving the message doesn't need to have been built yet at the time of message sending.

* **Higher bandwidth:** As we've already seen, we can carry a very large amount information into hashes on a proof of work system. Nodes on network, hash rate, proof of work accumulated, etc... Every user (node) on the network has the entire history of the chain, like a single consciousness held by multiple entities. Like being able to remember everything, perfectly.
